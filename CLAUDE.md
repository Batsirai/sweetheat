# Sweet Content

Multi-brand content production system. Seeds grow into Branches that bear Fruit.

## Stack
- **Frontend**: SvelteKit 5 (runes) on Cloudflare Workers
- **Database**: Convex (real-time, reactive)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS v4
- **Auth**: Simple session-based auth via Convex

## Convex
- Deployment: `loyal-hamster-102`
- Push schema: `npx convex dev --once`
- Run functions: `npx convex run <module>:<function>`

## Naming Convention (Botanical Metaphor)
- **Seeds** = raw ideas/inputs (PRD calls these "Sparks")
- **Branches** = content under development in a specific format (PRD calls these "Flames")
- **Fruit** = published content
- **Drafts** = versioned content within a branch

## Architecture
- Multi-tenant aware: `organizationId` on brands (nullable, single-org for now)
- Tool-agnostic: `integrations` table with pluggable adapters
- All queries are brand-scoped
- Agent API routes under `/api/*` authenticated via `AGENT_API_KEY`

## Development
```bash
nvm use 22
npm run dev          # Start dev server
npx convex dev       # Watch Convex changes
```

## Node Version
Requires Node 22+ (`.nvmrc` configured). Use `nvm use 22` before running commands.

## Enzyme CLI

Use the Enzyme CLI for retrieving context from this vault. Run all enzyme commands from the current directory.

### Working memory

Enzyme petri provides your working memory — entities and catalysts (thematic phrases) from the vault.
If petri context was injected automatically (via hook), you already have it. If not, run it yourself
after the user's first message:

- **Specific prompt** ("what pages have I built", "remind me about the auth discussion"):
  `enzyme petri --query "user's question"` — returns entities and catalysts ranked by relevance.
- **Broad prompt** ("hey", "explore my ideas", "what have I been thinking about"):
  `enzyme petri` — returns the full landscape: top entities by recency with all their catalysts.

Use the catalyst phrases as vocabulary for composing `enzyme catalyze` queries — they connect
to pre-computed content that the user's raw words won't find.

### Semantic search

`enzyme catalyze "query"` — search by concept/theme. Compose queries using catalyst vocabulary
from petri rather than the user's raw words.

Example flow:
1. Petri returns entity `design` with catalyst "iterative page design with distinct visual identities"
2. User asked "what pages have I built"
3. Compose: `enzyme catalyze "page creation iterative design visual identities"`

### Other commands

- `enzyme refresh` — re-index changed content (runs on hooks/crons, rarely needed manually)
- `enzyme apply ./target-dir` — index external content using vault catalysts, then `enzyme catalyze "query" --target ./target-dir`
- `grep` — exact tag, wikilink, or text matches (names, `#tags`, `[[links]]`)

**Tag search:** Tags appear as `- tag` in frontmatter and `#tag` inline. Search without `#` to catch both.

**Presentation registers:** Pass `--register` to catalyze to control framing:
- `explore` (default) — wonder, probe, notice patterns
- `continuity` — restore what the user knew, show trajectory, enable forward motion
- `reference` — surface what drew attention, connect imports to the user's own thinking

Results include `presentation_guidance` — follow these when framing the surfaced content.
